# SQLite-in-python

SQLite-PyLite is a simplified, lightweight implementation of an SQLite-like database engine, built entirely in Python. It supports basic SQL operations such as CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE (commonly referred to as CRUD operations).

This project is intended for educational purposes, providing insight into how a relational database works under the hood. It does not aim to replicate the full feature set of SQLite but rather focuses on implementing the core functionality in a minimal and understandable way.
